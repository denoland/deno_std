/**
 * Tar is a utility for collecting multiple files (or any arbitrary data) into one
 * archive file, while untar is the inverse utility to extract the files from an
 * archive.  Files are not compressed, only collected into the archive.
 *
 * ```ts no-eval
 * import { Tar } from "@std/archive/tar";
 * import { Buffer } from "@std/io/buffer";
 * import { copy } from "@std/io/copy";
 *
 * const tar = new Tar();
 *
 * // Now that we've created our tar, let's add some files to it:
 *
 * const content = new TextEncoder().encode("Some arbitrary content");
 * await tar.append("deno.txt", {
 *   reader: new Buffer(content),
 *   contentSize: content.byteLength,
 * });
 *
 * // This file is sourced from the filesystem (and renamed in the archive)
 * await tar.append("filename_in_archive.txt", {
 *   filePath: "./filename_on_filesystem.txt",
 * });
 *
 * // Now let's write the tar (with it's two files) to the filesystem
 * // use tar.getReader() to read the contents.
 *
 * const writer = await Deno.open("./out.tar", { write: true, create: true });
 * await copy(tar.getReader(), writer);
 * writer.close();
 * ```
 *

 * > **UNSTABLE**: New API, yet to be vetted.
